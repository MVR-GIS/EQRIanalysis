(Note: For A-E work, it is incumbent upon the Technical Lead (TL) to ensure the A-E has performed this level of review.)\n\n\n\n25: Have all critical graphics/plans gone through a rigorous QC process (e.g., a \"red dot\" review)? (Note: For A-E work, it is incumbent upon the Technical Lead (TL) to ensure the A-E has performed this level of review.)\n\n\n\n26: Have all specifications gone through a rigorous QC process? (Note: For A-E work, it is incumbent upon the Technical Lead (TL) to ensure the A-E has performed this level of review.)\n\n\n\n27: Have all models gone through a rigorous QC process? (e.g., a \"red dot\" review, clash detection, etc.)? (Note: For A-E work, it is incumbent upon the Technical Lead (TL) to ensure the A-E has performed this level of review.)\n\n\n\n28: Has a Biddability, Constructability, Operability, Environmental, and Sustainability (BCOES) review been performed in compliance with the ER?\n\n\n\n29: Have District Quality Control (DQC), Independent Technical Review (ITR)/Agency Technical Review (ATR), and Biddability, Constructability, Operability, Environmental, and Sustainability (BCOES) certifications been completed?\n\n\n\n30: Has the Quality Management Plan (QMP)/Review Plan (RP) been updated to respond to significant project changes?\n\n\n\n31: Does the design adequately accomplish the project scope, intent, and functional and technical objectives as defined in the current Project Management Plan (PMP)?\n\n\n\n32: Did the deliverable meet established design milestone expectations?\n\n\n\n33: Is the design maturity sufficient to generate the required Class of estimate for this milestone? (Class 3 at 35%, Class 2 at 65%, and Class 1 at 95%/100%)\n\n\n\n34: Does the project have a current risk register?\n\n\n\n35: Was the project budget verified with a Cost Schedule Risk Analysis (CSRA) at concept design (i.e., 35%)?\n\n\n\n36: Did the Geographic District validate and/or develop the Programmed Amount (PA)?\n\n\n\n37: Has there been turnover on your design or review team that may affect the team's ability to develop a quality product?\n\n\n\n38: What is your level of confidence in the quality of the engineering design efforts on this project?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
