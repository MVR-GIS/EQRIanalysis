\title{Plot Question-to-Indicator Mapping}
\usage{
plot_question_indicator_mapping(responses_df, sort_by = "indicator")
}
\arguments{
\item{responses_df}{data.frame; Responses from get_responses_df()}

\item{sort_by}{character; How to sort questions. Options: "indicator"
(group by indicator, default), "question" (numeric order), "count"
(by frequency of use)}
}
\value{
ggplot2 object

\description{
Visualize which questions contribute to each indicator score.
Shows the mapping between individual questions and the seven EQRI indicators
(Confidence, Cost, QA, QC, Schedule, Scope, Team).
}
\section{Interpretation}{

\itemize{
\item Each row represents a question
\item Each column represents an indicator
\item Colored cells show which questions contribute to which indicators
\item The count shows how many responses exist for that question-indicator pair
}
}

\section{Use Cases}{

This visualization helps identify:
\itemize{
\item Which questions define each indicator
\item Questions that contribute to multiple indicators (if any)
\item The relative contribution of each question to indicator scores
}
