\title{Prepare Wide Format Data for Reliability Analysis}
\usage{
get_wide_responses(responses_df, program_name = NULL, milestone_name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{responses_df}{data.frame; Long-format responses from get_responses_df()}

\item{program_name}{character; Program type. One of: "Military", "Civil Works",
or NULL to aggregate across all programs}

\item{milestone_name}{character; Project milestone. One of:
"15\% (Project Initiation)", "35\% (Concept Design)",
"65\% (Intermediate Design)", "95\% (Final Design)",
"100\% (Corrected Final Design)", or NULL to aggregate across all milestones}
}
\value{
data.frame in wide format with one row per questionnaire event,
one column per question (named Q1, Q2, etc.), values are RESPONSEVALUE
}
\description{
Convert long-format responses to wide format suitable for
psychometric analysis. Each row represents one questionnaire event,
columns represent question responses. Can filter to specific context or
aggregate across contexts for factor analysis.
}
\section{Development Notes}{

This function was updated 2026-02-21 to support context aggregation
for factor analysis with adequate sample sizes. Parameters now accept
NULL to aggregate across program types and/or milestones.
See \verb{dev/sessions/2026-02-21.md} for complete development context.

Per Flora & Curran, factor analysis of ordinal data requires minimum
N = 200 for stable polychoric correlations. Aggregation across contexts
may be necessary to achieve adequate sample size.
