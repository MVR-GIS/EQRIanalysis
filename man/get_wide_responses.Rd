\title{Prepare Wide Format Data for Reliability Analysis}
\usage{
get_wide_responses(responses_df, program_name, milestone_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{responses_df}{data.frame; Long-format responses from get_responses_df()}

\item{program_name}{character; REQUIRED. Program type. One of:
"Military", "Civil Works"}

\item{milestone_name}{character; REQUIRED. Project milestone. One of:
"15\% (Project Initiation)", "35\% (Concept Design)",
"65\% (Intermediate Design)", "95\% (Final Design)",
"100\% (Corrected Final Design)"}
}
\value{
data.frame in wide format with one row per questionnaire event,
one column per question (named Q1, Q2, etc.), values are RESPONSEVALUE.
This represents the complete questionnaire as administered in this context.
}
\description{
Convert long-format responses to wide format suitable for
psychometric analysis. Each row represents one questionnaire event,
columns represent question responses. Filters to a specific questionnaire
context (program type × milestone) where all questions are administered.

Per psychometric best practice, reliability is assessed for the complete
instrument (all questions) within a specific administration context,
not for individual subscales (indicators) in isolation.
